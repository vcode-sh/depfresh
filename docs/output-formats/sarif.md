# SARIF Output

```bash
bump --output sarif
```

The type exists in the codebase. The implementation does not. It's on the roadmap.

SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) would make bump's output consumable by GitHub Code Scanning, VS Code, and other tools that speak the format. When it lands, you'll be the first to know. Well, second -- I'll know first.
