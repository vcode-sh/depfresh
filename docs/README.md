# Documentation

You opened the docs. Voluntarily. I'm genuinely impressed -- most people just guess at flags until something works, then commit before anyone notices.

Everything I know about bump is in here, split into files so you can pretend you'll read more than one.

## Table of Contents

- **[CLI Reference](./cli.md)** -- All 27+ flags, range modes, sorting, filtering, lifecycle hooks, interactive mode, CI usage, and workspace support. The one you'll actually read.

- **[Configuration](./configuration.md)** -- Config files, every option worth documenting, `packageMode`, `depFields`, private registries, cache settings. For people who think defaults are a personal insult.

- **[Programmatic API](./api.md)** -- Exported functions, lifecycle callbacks, types, and workflow examples. For when you want to wrap bump in your own tooling and take credit for it. I respect the hustle.

- **[Output Formats](./output-formats.md)** -- Table, JSON, SARIF, exit codes, and AI agent integration. Machines deserve documentation too. They're doing most of the work anyway.

- **[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md)** -- Common issues, workspace gotchas, and known limitations. The page you'll find via Google at 2 AM after everything breaks. I've been there. The kettle's already on.
