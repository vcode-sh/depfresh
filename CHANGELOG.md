# Changelog

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Semver because I'm not a psychopath.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-22

First release. Wrote it from scratch because waiting for PRs to get merged in taze was aging me faster than JavaScript frameworks.

### Added

- Full CLI with 15 flags that actually make sense. Powered by citty because I have taste.
- Config resolution via unconfig + defu. Supports `bump.config.ts`, `.bumprc`, or `package.json#bump`. Pick your poison.
- Registry fetching with p-limit concurrency. 16 parallel requests by default because patience is not a virtue, it's a bottleneck.
- SQLite cache (better-sqlite3, WAL mode). Falls back to memory if native modules aren't available. No JSON file race conditions. You're welcome.
- `.npmrc` parsing that actually works. Scoped registries, auth tokens, the whole thing. Taze ignored this for 4 years. I fixed it on day one.
- Retry with exponential backoff. 2 retries by default. I won't accidentally DDoS the npm registry.
- `--output json` for scripts and AI agents. Clean structured envelope. No ANSI codes. No log noise. Just data.
- Interactive mode with @clack/prompts. Pick what to update like a civilised person.
- Workspace catalog support for pnpm, Bun, and Yarn. Catalogs get bumped alongside your deps. No manual sync.
- 7 range modes: `default`, `major`, `minor`, `patch`, `latest`, `newest`, `next`. From cautious to chaotic, your choice.
- Include/exclude regex filtering. Update what you want, ignore what you don't. Revolutionary.
- `--deps-only` and `--dev-only` because sometimes you only want half the pain.
- Semantic exit codes: `0` = chill, `1` = updates available, `2` = something broke.
- Programmatic API with lifecycle callbacks. `beforePackageStart`, `onDependencyResolved`, `beforePackageWrite`, `afterPackageWrite`. Build whatever workflow your heart desires.
- `npm:` and `jsr:` protocol support. Because the ecosystem wasn't confusing enough.
- Nested override/resolution flattening for the brave souls running complex monorepos.
- TTY detection. No spinners in your CI logs. `NO_COLOR` respected.
- 54 tests. More than some production apps I've seen.
