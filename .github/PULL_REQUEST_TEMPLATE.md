## What's this then?

<!-- Explain your changes. If you can't do it in a sentence, your PR is probably too big. -->

## Type

- [ ] Bug fix (something was broken, now it's less broken)
- [ ] Feature (something new that didn't exist before)
- [ ] Breaking change (something that will make people update their code and complain on Twitter)
- [ ] Docs (words about code -- ironically harder than writing the code)
- [ ] Refactor (same behaviour, fewer regrets)
- [ ] Chore (the unglamorous work nobody notices until it's not done)

## Checklist

- [ ] Tests pass. I ran them. Personally.
- [ ] Types pass. TypeScript is satisfied, which is more than I can say for myself.
- [ ] Lint passes. Biome has accepted my offering.
- [ ] I wrote tests for my changes. Shocking, I know.
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated (if this is user-facing)
