# Code of Conduct

Adapted from the [Contributor Covenant 2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).

## TL;DR

Be decent. That's the whole thing.

If you need a document to tell you not to be awful to strangers on the internet, this is that document. The fact that it needs to exist is itself a commentary on the state of things.

## Do

- Treat people with basic respect. Groundbreaking stuff, I know.
- Welcome different perspectives. The person disagreeing with your approach might be saving you from yourself.
- Take feedback without taking it personally. Your code is not your identity. Unless it's really bad code, in which case maybe reconsider.
- Focus on the project. Save the drama for your Kubernetes cluster.

## Don't

- Harass, troll, insult, or personally attack anyone.
- Use sexualised language, imagery, or make unwelcome advances. Read the room.
- Publish someone's private information. That's not edgy, it's illegal.
- Do anything a reasonable adult would be embarrassed about if their mum saw it.

Sarcasm about code? Encouraged. Sarcasm about people? Don't. There's a line and you know exactly where it is.

## Enforcement

Report violations to **hello@vcode.sh**. All complaints are reviewed and investigated.

Graduated consequences:

1. **Warning** -- a private note explaining what you did wrong and why.
2. **Temporary ban** -- you're out for a while. Go touch grass.
3. **Permanent ban** -- you're out forever. Don't let the door hit you.

I genuinely hope I never have to use any of these.

## Scope

This covers all project spaces -- issues, PRs, discussions, anywhere you're representing this project. What you do on your own time is your business. What you do here is mine.
